<h1>1. Introduction</h1>
<p>Aqualung is an advanced music player originally targeted at
the GNU/Linux operating system, today also running on FreeBSD,
OpenBSD and Microsoft Windows. It plays audio CDs, internet
radio streams and podcasts as well as soundfiles in just about
any audio format and has the feature of inserting <b><i>no
gaps</i></b> between adjacent tracks. It also supports high
quality sample rate conversion between the file and the output
device, when necessary.</p>
<p>Audio CDs can be played back and ripped with on-the-fly
conversion to WAV, FLAC, Ogg Vorbis or CBR/VBR MP3 (gapless via
LAME). Seamless tagging of the created files is offered as part
of the process. Internet radio stations streaming Ogg Vorbis or
MP3 are supported. Subscribing to RSS and Atom audio podcasts is
supported: Aqualung can automatically download and add new files
to the Music Store. Optional limits for the age, size and number
of downloaded files can be set.</p>
<p>Almost all sample-based, uncompressed formats (e.g. WAV,
AIFF, AU etc.), as well as files encoded with FLAC (the Free
Lossless Audio Codec), Ogg Vorbis, Ogg Speex, MPEG Audio
(including the infamous MP3 format), MOD audio formats (MOD,
S3M, XM, IT, etc.), Musepack and Monkey's Audio Codec are
supported. Numerous formats and codecs are also supported via
the FFmpeg project, including AC3, AAC, WMA, WavPack and the
soundtrack of many video formats. There is also a native
(non-FFmpeg) WavPack decoder. The program can play the music
through OSS, ALSA, sndio, PulseAudio, the JACK Audio Connection
Kit, or even using the Win32 Sound API (available only under
Cygwin or native Win32). Depending on the compile-time options,
not all file formats and output drivers may be usable in a
particular build. Type <code>aqualung -v</code> to get a list of
all the compiled-in features.</p>
<p>Aqualung supports the LADSPA 1.1 plugin standard. You can use
any suitable plugin to enhance the music you are listening
to.</p>
<p>Other features of the program are: tabbed playlist,
internally working volume and balance controls (not touching the
soundcard mixer), multiple skin support, random seeking during
playback, track repeat, list repeat and shuffle mode (besides
normal playback). In track repeat mode the looping range is
adjustable. Aqualung will come up in the same state as it was
when you closed it, including playback modes, volume and balance
settings, currently processing LADSPA plugins, window sizes,
positions and visibility, and other miscellaneous
options. Aqualung has the ability to display and edit Ogg Xiph
comments, ID3v1, ID3v2 and APE tags, as well as FLAC picture
frames found in files that support them. See the section about
<a href="aqualung-doc-part_6.html#id38">metadata support</a> for full reference.</p>
<p>The method of assembling the title string of a track is programmable
(via a user-provided Lua function) and can include nearly any metadata
item or audio file attribute. See the documentation of the
<a href="aqualung-doc-part_7_1.html#id805"><span class="gui">Lua extension file</span>
config setting</a> for full reference.</p>
<p>You can control any running instance of the program remotely
from the command line (start, stop, pause etc.). Remote loading
or enqueueing soundfiles as well as complete playlists is also
supported.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, Aqualung provides a so-called Music
Store that is an XML-based music database, capable of storing
various metadata about music on your computer (including, but
not limited to, the names of artists, and the titles of records
and tracks). You can (and should) organize your music into trees
of Artists/Records/Tracks, thereby making life easier than with
the all-in-one Winamp/XMMS playlist. Importing file metadata
(ID3v1, ID3v2 tags, Ogg Xiph comments, APE metadata) into the
Music Store as well as getting track names from a CDDB/FreeDB
database is supported. For audio CDs, CD-Text retrieval is also
implemented.</p>
