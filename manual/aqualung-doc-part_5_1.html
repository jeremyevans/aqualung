Exporting files from the Music Store or Playlist</h2>

<p>It is possible to export files from the Music Store or
Playlist to external formats. This is especially handy if you
own a portable music player, since it can be easily filled
with music you already have on your computer, transcoding and
tagging the files so they can be readily used by the
device. The feature is available from the right-click popup
menus (both in Music Store and Playlist), and via the shortcut
`x' or `X' (in Music Store only). It operates on the
selected Music Store node, or the selected tracks in the
Playlist.</p>

<p>The export dialog handles the settings of output directory,
filename and file format. Subdirectories can be created for
artists and/or records, with adjustable limit for the length
of the created directory names. The actual filename is
generated using the filename template. This template is very
similar to the well-known <span class="gui">Title format</span> in <a href="aqualung-doc-part_7_1.html#id805">Settings / General</a>, only it
accepts a few more special sequences: `%o' for the
original audio filename (without extension), `%n' for the
track number (two digit, zero padded), `%i' for an
identifier which is unique within an export session, and
`%x' for the file extension. The latter is determined by
the output file format, and will be one of `flac',
`ogg', `mp3' or `wav'.</p>

<p>The file format setting is exactly the same as with CD
ripping, refer to <a href="aqualung-doc-part_4_3.html#id13">this section</a> for
details.</p>

<p>The metadata of the exported files is transcoded to the new
format as well as the audio data; read more about this <a href="aqualung-doc-part_6_3.html#id22">here</a>.</p>
