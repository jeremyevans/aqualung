<h3 id="id7">4.3.1. Overview</h3>

<p>The Music Store is a simple database of all your
music. The central philosophy of this program is that you
have a large storage (ideally an entire hard drive or a
separate partition) to store all your music files. This is
not necessary for the program to work. The audio files can
be scattered around your system as long as you have read
permissions to them. However, it is strongly recommended
that you devote a separate directory for all the music (for
example, <tt>/music</tt> would be a convenient place to
store files that are owned by root, but readable by all
users). Moreover, you can maintain several collections on
different machines this way, and share them with other users
via NFS, while keeping a (probably smaller) collection on
your local hard drive.</p>

<p>In these central directories, create subdirectories for
each artist you have CDs from. The directory names do not
have to contain the exact names, you can for example create
<tt>/music/ledzep</tt> for Led Zeppelin,
<tt>/music/crimson</tt> for King Crimson,
<tt>/music/hendrix</tt> for Jimi Hendrix and so on. In
these directories, create subdirectories for each CD you
have. Once again, the directory names for the records do not
need to fully contain the record titles; they can be short
and without spaces and special characters.</p>

<p>Into the directories of records, you should rip the CD
using the built-in ripper of Aqualung, tagging the files and
adding the record to the Music Store as part of the
process. See <a href="aqualung-doc-part_4_3.html#id13">this section</a> for
details.</p>



<h3 id="id8">4.3.2. Building or Updating a store from filesystem</h3>

<p>Aqualung comes with a Music Store Builder facility, which
allows you to easily create a store from your existing audio
files. This is essential if you already have a large music
collection on your harddrive. Please make sure to read <a href="aqualung-doc-part_5_4.html#id478">this section</a> to understand the
concepts and usage of this feature.</p>



<h3 id="id9">4.3.3. Arranging your collection</h3>

<p>Each store, artist, record and track has fields you can
fill in via bringing up the <span class="gui">Edit</span> dialog for that
item. The <span class="gui">Visible name</span> is obviously the string
that will appear in the Music Store tree, and in the
Playlist. The <span class="gui">Name to sort by</span> is a string key
used for sorting items on the same level of hierarchy (all
artists, records of a given artist, and tracks of a given
record).</p>

<p>For artists, you should enter the same here as the
<span class="gui">Visible name</span> for ordinary band names (you can use
copy &amp; paste to do that, or simply press ENTER while the
cursor is in the visible name entry). However, for some
artists you will enter a slightly modified string:
`Mayall, John' or just `Mayall' for John Mayall,
for example. This is to ensure that `John Mayall'
(which is the visible name) appears between
`Mahavishnu' and `Morphine', and not somewhere
near `Jethro Tull'.</p>

<p>Records have a <span class="gui">Year</span> field to store the release
year. The <span class="gui">Name to sort by</span> field should usually be
this year, but you can use explicit numbering or whatever
you like as well. If multiple records of an artist have the
same year (double albums, multi-CD collections, or just
multiple studio albums published in the same year), you may
use e.g. `1969-1', `1969-2', etc. to keep them in
proper order.</p>

<p>As for tracks, a two-digit, zero-padded decimal numbering
would be excellent for the sort key. If you added tracks to
the records using the aforementioned <span class="gui">Auto-create tracks
from these files</span> feature of the Record add dialog, the
tracks will be automatically numbered for you this way.</p>

<p>Last but not least, every item has a <span class="gui">Comment</span>
field that may contain multiple lines of text, and is
perfectly optional to use for any store, artist, record or
track. When you have entered something in this field, it
will be displayed in the lower area of the Music Store
window when the corresponding item is selected in the
tree. Use this to store miscellaneous data, such as birth
dates of artists, or comments like `Recorded live at Royal
Albert Hall, ...' or `Digitized from original LP'
for records, and movement subtitles for tracks that have
them.</p>



<h3 id="id10">4.3.4. Dealing with multiple stores</h3>

<p>As mentioned before, you may maintain several collections
of audio files on several machines. Each collection is
arranged in an artist/record/track hierarchy, and appears
under a store item in the Music Store tree. The metadata
describing one collection is located in one file on your
filesystem.</p>

<p>On the <span class="gui">Settings / Music Store</span> page you can
specify several database files whose content is intended to
appear in your Music Store. If a given file is unavailable,
the corresponding store item will be missing from the Music
Store. If the file is readonly, you can play the music, but
you won't be allowed to change (add, edit, remove, etc.) the
items in the store. Finally, if you have write permission on
the file, you will be allowed to change the items.</p>

<p>The order in which the stores appear in the Music Store
is the order of the corresponding database files in the
list. The list can be reordered via drag &amp; drop.</p>



<h3 id="id11">4.3.5. Handling file metadata</h3>

<p>The program can read and write all sorts of metadata
(normally referred to as `tags' in everyday speech)
embedded in the audio files themselves. To see such metadata for
a particular track, you will utilize the <span class="gui">File info</span>
dialog accessible from the Music Store (right-click popup menus
for Tracks, or press `i') and the Playlist (right-click
popup menu for Playlist entries, or press `i').</p>

<p>When you open the <span class="gui">File info</span> dialog from the
Music Store, you will find buttons to the right of every
metadata field that was read from the file (unless the store
is readonly). By pressing these buttons, the associated data
will be imported into the corresponding field of the
relevant Track. For metadata fields that don't have a
corresponding field in the Music Store, you can append their
contents to the <span class="gui">Comment</span> field as a catch-all
solution.</p>

<p>Please make sure to check out the comprehensive guide to
Aqualung's <a href="aqualung-doc-part_6.html#id38">metadata
capabilities</a>.</p>



<h3 id="id12">4.3.6. CDDB Support</h3>

<p>Aqualung supports retrieving matches from a CDDB
database.  The feature is available by right-clicking
on a record in the Music Store and choosing the appropriate
menu item.</p>

<p>The CDDB query option starts a query (which can last a
bit long if there are a lot of matches), and displays a
dialog with the search results. It tends to work even if you
have already encoded your audio files in a lossy format.</p>

<p>If there are multiple matches, you can select any of them
using the combo box at the top of the dialog. The displayed
fields are all editable, which is useful in case you find no
fully acceptable match, but want to use one that is almost
perfect. The track names can be edited by double-clicking on
the desired track, or single clicking on an already selected
entry.</p>

<p>By pressing the <span class="gui">OK</span> button the track names of
the currently selected lookup results will be propagated
into the Music Store. The artist name, record title and year
are not automatically set, but can be imported using the
<span class="gui">Import as Artist</span>, <span class="gui">Import as Title</span> and
<span class="gui">Import as Year</span> buttons on the right. Record title
and year can also be imported as sort keys, after you once
pressed the corresponding import button. Other data
(category, genre and extended data) can be appended to the
comment field of the record in question using the <span class="gui">Add
to Comments</span> button next to the appropriate text
entry.</p>



<h3 id="id13">4.3.7. Audio CD</h3>

<p>If Aqualung was compiled with Audio CD support, a store
called `CD Audio' appears as the first store in Music
Store. This special store contains a node for each drive in
your machine. Detecting hot-swappable devices such as
external USB drives is supported, so you don't need to
restart the program after plugging in your drive. Aqualung
will notice not only the change of discs in devices, but
device changes themselves, too.</p>

<p>When you insert a CD in a drive, the corresponding node
will contain the audio tracks on that disc. The artist,
record and track names are automatically set from CD-Text
information if found on the CD, or a CDDB lookup.</p>

<p>The drive nodes have options available from the popup
menu for adding content to the Playlist, and manual CDDB
lookup just like normal album nodes do. They have
some further CD specific options as well.</p>

<p>The most important feature is ripping the CD. Choosing
<span class="gui">Rip CD...</span> from the popup menu will bring up a
dialog with several options broken into notebook pages. The
<span class="gui">Source</span> page is for selecting the tracks to be
ripped, and specifying the artist, record and track
names. If the CDDB lookup was successful, these fields are
initialized appropriately. On the <span class="gui">Output</span> page you
can select the directory where to put the audio files, and
optionally the music store to which you would like to add
the ripped CD. The destination directory must be empty; it
is best to create a fresh new directory each time you rip a
CD. Only music stores with write permission are offered, so
you might not see all of them. The desired file/encoding
format can also be selected, along with settings concerning
quality, such as compression level or bitrate. The supported
destination formats are WAV, FLAC, Ogg Vorbis and MP3. There
is also an option to set whether the files should be tagged
with metadata. (WAV does not have a tagging mechanism. Other
formats are tagged according to their native tagging
mechanism.)</p>

<p>CD Ripping always happens with maximum available speed
and with error correction modes manually set before every
run on the last page titled <span class="gui">Paranoia</span>. Here you
can basically choose between safe and slow ripping, and
faster, but more insecure operation. The latter might be
useful if you know by experience that your equipment is
reliable, and the CD you are about to rip is not scratched
or dirty. Even so, it is probably a good idea to use the
available extra error protection unless you are really in a
hurry.</p>

<p>It is possible to display information about the inserted
disc (CD-Text), or the drive itself (general info, reading
or writing capabilities, etc.). The tray can also be
ejected, if the driver supports this operation. Note that
ripping and playing a CD at the same time is impossible for
obvious reasons.</p>



<h3 id="id14">4.3.8. Podcast support</h3>

<p>If Aqualung is compiled with podcast support, you will have a
store called `Podcasts' in your Music Store. All feeds you
are subscribed to will show up as nodes under this store.
Subscriptions can be made using the <span class="gui">Subscribe to new
feed</span> right-click menu of the `Podcasts' store.</p>

<p>When you subscribe to a feed, you need to enter the URL
of the feed and a directory where to put the downloaded
files. Supported feed formats are all versions of RSS and
Atom.  The podcast support only works with http URLs, not https
URLs.</p>


<p>Aqualung can automatically check for updates and download
new files. The check interval can be specified in hours,
with a 0.25 hour resolution. The automatic update facility
can be disabled for a feed by unchecking the checkbutton
before the name of this option.</p>

<p>There are three different limits that you can apply on a
per feed basis. All of them are optional, and can be turned
on/off with their respective checkbutton.</p>

<ul>

<li>Maximum number of items: the number of downloaded
files will never exceed this. If necessary, Aqualung will
delete older files to meet this requirement.</li>

<li>Remove older items: Aqualung will automatically remove
files that are older than the given number of days. If a
feed offers files for download that are older than this
limit, they won't even be downloaded. Note that if a feed
incorrectly specifies the date of the items, it may happen
that no files are downloaded due to this limit &ndash; if
so, turn it off, and update again.</li>

<li>Maximum space to use: the downloaded files will not
occupy more space than specified by this option.</li>

</ul>

<p>If some files need to be deleted due to limit
constraints, the oldest one will be removed first to keep
fresh material available as long as possible. Once you have
subscribed to a feed, you can edit the check interval and
limit settings using the <span class="gui">Edit feed</span> menu
item.</p>

<p>New feeds are appended to the `Podcasts' store.
They can be reordered later using the <span class="gui">Reorder
feeds</span> menu item of the `Podcasts' store.</p>

<p>There is a check menu item called <span class="gui">Automatically
update feeds</span> in the `Podcasts' store popup menu
to globally enable/disable automatic feed updates for all
feeds. If unchecked, the <span class="gui">Edit Feed</span> dialog will
show a note about this option being disabled instead of the
feed's own check interval.</p>

<p>When a feed is being updated, its title is changed to
indicate how many new files are to be downloaded, and shows
the completion ratio as well. You can abort an update
process by clicking the <span class="gui">Abort ongoing update</span>
right-click menu item of the feed in question, which is
naturally available only during updates.</p>
