<p>The <span class="gui">General</span> tab itself is further divided into
tabs, which are explained below.</p>

<h3 id="id33">7.1.1. Main Window</h3>

<p>The options controlling the behavior of the Main Window
speak for themselves. One advantage of combining the Play
and Pause buttons is that it allows for starting playback
and later toggling between play and pause with the same
remote command, `<code>aqualung -N0 --play</code>'. It is
useful if your keyboard has a combined Play/Pause multimedia
button and you want to utilize its functionality to control
Aqualung via remote commands.</p>



<h3 id="id34">7.1.2. Title Format</h3>

<p>The <span class="gui">Title format</span> string will be used to
construct a single title line from an Artist, a Record and a
Track name when adding songs to the Playlist. The Artist,
Record and Track names should appear as `%a', `%r'
and `%t' flags in the template, respectively.</p>

<p>Conditional string elements can be inserted using a
`<code>?A1|A2|...|An{CONTENT}</code>' expression, where
each <code>Ai</code> should be a subset of the available flag
characters (that is, the set {a,r,t}). The value of the
conditional expression is the logical OR of the individual
<code>Ai</code> expressions. The value of an <code>Ai</code>
expression is true if all strings are available whose flag
character appears in the expression in question (logical
AND).</p>

<p>If the conditional is true, the content of the following
pair of braces will be inserted, otherwise it will be
skipped. The <code>CONTENT</code> string may contain the flags
`%a', `%r' or `%t' as well.</p>

<p>If you want to insert a literal `%', `?' or
`}' you should write `%%', `%?' or `%}',
respectively, except for a `?' inside <code>CONTENT</code>,
and a `}' outside <code>CONTENT</code>, where they can
appear unquoted. Of course it is good practice to always
escape these characters for the sake of clarity if one needs
them literally.</p>

<p>Everything that is neither a conditional expression nor a
flag will be copied verbatim into the result.</p>

<p>Note that the expression `?a{%a}' is equivalent to
`%a' since the flags will only be substituted if the
corresponding string is available, so there's no need for the
extra check.</p>

<p>An example title format is `%a?ar|at{ - }%r?rt{ -
}%t'. Using this format string, one would get the following
components, in order:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td>%a</td>
<td>artist name if available</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>?ar|at{ - }</td>
<td>if (artist AND record) OR (artist AND track) available, the string ` - '</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>%r</td>
<td>record name if available</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>?rt{ - }</td>
<td>if (record AND track) available, the string ` - '</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>%t</td>
<td>track name, if available</td>
</tr>
</table>



<h3 id="id35">7.1.3. Lua extension file</h3>

<p>This section is only available if Aqualung is compiled
with Lua extension support.  If so, it specifies the
file to use for the extension support  See the Extending
Aqualung section for details about what's possible to
include in this file.</p>



<h3 id="id36">7.1.4. Systray</h3>

<p>This page is present only if Aqualung was compiled with
systray support. Even if it is supported, it can be turned
off here, which naturally makes further configuration
useless. If systray is enabled, Aqualung can start in
minimized state &ndash; a useful feature if the program is
launched automatically from the startup script of the window
manager.</p>

<p>Mouse button and wheel events on the tray icon are
supported and can be assigned configurable commands. You can
assign separate commands to the vertical and horizontal
mouse wheels. Choose the desired command from the list
displayed by the corresponding combo box.</p>

<p>The left and right mouse buttons are reserved for
hiding/showing the windows and popping up the context menu,
respectively. Any other buttons can be bound to a custom
command by adding a new button to the list. In the presented
dialog, move the cursor over the test panel and press the
button you want to configure. Below the test panel, choose
the appropriate action to be taken when you click on the
tray icon with the selected mouse button. One button can be
assigned only one command at a time. To change an already
configured button, remove it from the list first and add it
again.</p>



<h3 id="id37">7.1.5. Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>The so-called <span class="gui">Implicit command line</span> is something
you should pay attention to. It exists mainly for those who
have a stable sound setup and always use the program with the
same output device, e.g. they have only OSS and don't plan to
upgrade. For such users it may be cumbersome to always specify
the desired output device on the command line, along with its
optional parameters if needed. So here you may enter something
that you would otherwise enter on the command line every
time.</p>

<p>But beware: you cannot override or turn off every option,
so for example if you enter `--help' here, the program
will always display the standard message and exit immediately;
and there is no way to override that from the command line. If
you get into trouble, all you have to (or can) do is grab a
text editor and hack it out of
<tt>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/aqualung/config.xml</tt> where it is
stored (note that $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is most likely ~/.config).
You will find it between `&lt;default_param&gt;' and
`&lt;/default_param&gt;'.</p>

<p>There are also some options to handle the display of album
cover art. This feature is automatically triggered when an
image file is found in the same directory as the track being
played. The filenames that will at first be looked for are
`cover.ext', `.cover.ext', `front.ext',
`.front.ext', `folder.ext', `.folder.ext',
where `ext' is one of `jpg', `jpeg',
`png', `gif', `bmp', `tif',
`tiff'. If none of them exists, the first image file
having an appropriate extension will be used. If you select a
record (or one of its tracks) in the Music Store, the image
will be displayed in the comment pane. It is also shown in the
File Info dialog as well as the main window during the
playback of a track from this album. Clicking the image will
show a zoomed version of the cover.</p>

<p>When playing files or viewing them in the <span class="gui">File
info</span> dialog, embedded pictures are also used for cover
display. If an embedded picture frame is found in file
metadata, it is displayed instead of any separate image
file. If there is more than one embedded picture in the file,
the first one is used. In these cases no separate image file
is used, so the embedded image found in file metadata is
displayed regardless of any separate image in the audio file's
directory.</p>

<p>There are some global options to set here as well, which
should be quite obvious to use.</p>
