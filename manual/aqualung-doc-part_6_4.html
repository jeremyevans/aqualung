<h3 id="id24">6.4.2. ID3v1</h3>

<p>ID3v1 and ID3v1.1 (<a class="external" href="http://www.id3.org/ID3v1">http://www.id3.org/ID3v1</a>)
are fully supported. The difference between the two is the
presence or absence of a separate Track Number field, which
was added in ID3v1.1. Aqualung automatically parses the tag
choosing the right version. When writing the tag, it is
written as ID3v1.1 if a Track Number frame is present, and
written as ID3v1 otherwise.</p>

<p>The Genre field has a fixed set of possible contents in
ID3v1 and ID3v1.1. This is enforced by a drop-down menu in
the metadata editor GUI.</p>



<h3 id="id25">6.4.3. ID3v2</h3>

<p>ID3v2 tags are supported with the restriction that the
tag MUST be at the beginning of the file. Tag versions
before ID3v2.3 are considered obsolete and not
supported. Support for ID3v2.3 tags (<a class="external" href="http://id3.org/id3v2.3.0">http://id3.org/id3v2.3.0</a>)
is read-only, meaning that they are parsed, but converted to
ID3v2.4 whenever saved back to file. ID3v2.4 tags (<a class="external" href="http://id3.org/id3v2.4.0-structure">http://id3.org/id3v2.4.0-structure</a>)
are supported in both read and write mode.</p>

<p>ID3v2.4 tags are always written using UTF-8 as the string
encoding of non-ASCII text data, and unconditionally
employing unsynchronisation on all frames. Extended headers
are neither parsed nor written. Padding is added when
creating a new file (via CD ripping or file export) or
rewriting a tag that does not fit in its earlier space
(e.g. when adding a picture frame, which is usually larger
than the remaining padding, thus mandating the re-writing of
the whole file). In these cases the policy for determining
the amount of padding is that the size of the tag should be
an integer multiple of 2K, and the added padding should be
between 2K and 4K.</p>

<p>Not every frame defined by the ID3v2 standards is
implemented; however, the commonly used subset of the frames
is available. In particular, all text information frames
(T***) including `User defined text frame' (TXXX), URL
link frames (W***) including `User defined URL link
frame' (WXXX), comments (COMM), relative volume
adjustment 2 (RVA2), and attached picture (APIC) frames are
supported.</p>

<p>Some ID3v2.3 frames that have been discontinued in
ID3v2.4 are supported by reading and converting them to
other (functionally equivalent) frames: TDAT, TIME, TRDA and
TYER are treated as TDRC and TORY is treated as TDOR.</p>

<p>Note that the RVAD frame in ID3v2.3 is not supported.</p>



<h3 id="id26">6.4.4. APE</h3>

<p>APEv1 and <a class="external" href="http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=APEv2_specification">APEv2</a>
tags are supported with the restriction that the tag MUST be
located at the end of the file, possibly before an ID3v1
tag. <a class="external" href="http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=APE_key">Standard
items</a> are supported as well as ReplayGain-related
frames, and picture frames which are by convention binary
items identified by a key starting with `Cover Art'
followed by the picture type definition in brackets. This is
compatible with most existing tagging software.</p>



<h3 id="id27">6.4.5. Ogg Xiph comments</h3>

<p>Ogg Xiph comments (also known as Ogg Vorbis comments) are
supported according to the recommended field names in the <a class="external" href="http://xiph.org/vorbis/doc/v-comment.html">Vorbis
format spec</a>. In addition to this, COMMENT, DISC, and
ReplayGain-related fields are also supported.
</p>



<h3 id="id28">6.4.6. FLAC pictures</h3>

<p>In FLAC files there may be an Ogg Xiph comment block
along with separate picture blocks that contain one embedded
picture each. This tag is Aqualung's pseudo-tag for
referring to the set of picture blocks in a FLAC file, so
the only frame you can add to this tag is the
`Attached picture'.</p>



<h3 id="id29">6.4.7. Musepack ReplayGain data</h3>

<p>In <a class="external" href="http://trac.musepack.net/trac/wiki/SV7Specification">Musepack
SV7</a> streams there may be ReplayGain data in the file
(not in a metadata tag, but in the coded audio data
itself). Technically, it is always present, but is only
treated as existent when it is nonzero. Aqualung displays
(and has the capability to use) this information by
referring to it as a `Musepack ReplayGain' pseudo-tag
(which, again, is not a proper metadata tag in
reality). This information is read-only.
</p>



<h3 id="id30">6.4.8. Generic StreamMetadata</h3>

<p>This is a read-only pseudo-tag carrying information that
was obtained when speaking to the Icecast or SHOUTcast
stream server. Specifically, the relevant HTTP header fields
received from the server are saved in this pseudo-tag and
made available for viewing. These currently include the
`Icy-Name', `Icy-Description' and `Icy-Genre'
fields.</p>



<h3 id="id31">6.4.9. MPEG StreamMetadata</h3>

<p>This is a read-only pseudo-tag carrying information that
was received while listening to an MPEG stream on internet
radio via <a class="external" href="http://www.smackfu.com/stuff/programming/shoutcast.html">SHOUTcast</a>.
This information consists of `key:value' pairs, and is
thus fairly similar to Ogg Xiph comments. Usually internet
broadcast stations include only a small number of fields,
but since the field name is included in the transmission,
there is no restriction on the supported fields.</p>



<h3 id="id32">6.4.10. MOD information</h3>

<p>For files handled by the MOD library, some read-only
information about the file (number of channels, instruments,
etc.) is displayed.</p>
