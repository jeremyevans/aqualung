Setting up a Music Store</h2>

<p>Now that you have some music playing, let's get more
organized. In the Music Store window click in the empty area
with the right mouse button and choose <span class="gui">Create empty
store...</span> from the menu. Enter a meaningful name such as
`Tom's Music' and choose a location to save the XML file
of the store to. This should be a writable location, so it is
wise to stick to a location inside your home directory. (A
system-wide path or a remote NFS mount with read-only access
won't do.)</p>

<p>You can have any number of such stores in the Music Store
organizer, and it is indeed a great idea to have separate
stores for music differentiated by origin, genre, or some
other aspect. One great use is multiple stores with the actual
music files stored on multiple remote machines, one store for
each machine. Or just a store for your local music and another
for files on your bedroom file server box. There are several
possibilities.</p>

<p>But how do you populate the store with music you already
have on your drive? It's easy if your music is stored in an
organized manner on the filesystem level. As a minimum, this
means that tracks intended to go into one store are found
under a common root directory in the filesystem (there may be
several directory layers down from the root to the individual
files, but there must be a common ancestor). In this case the
so-called Music Store Builder will take care of things for
you. Right-click on your newly-created empty store and choose
<span class="gui">Build / Update store from filesystem</span>. Choose
Independent mode and in the dialog you get, enter the root
directory under which your collection resides. As you can
probably guess at this point, the store builder interface is
pretty flexible, however the default settings should be good
to get something together quickly without further hassle.</p>

<p>Pressing <span class="gui">OK</span> will start the process, during which
the directory structure below the root you specified will be
traversed. The artist/record/track names are determined from
potentially multiple data sources (CDDB, metadata e.g. ID3v2
tags or Ogg Xiph comments, and filesystem names). The logic
involved is fairly elaborate. You are strongly advised to <a href="aqualung-doc-part_5_4.html#id478">read</a> the detailed usage instructions
for the Music Store Builder.</p>
