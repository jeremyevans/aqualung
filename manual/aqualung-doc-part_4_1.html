Main Window</h2>

<p>You can control most of the program from this window. The
cue controls in the bottom-left corner are fairly obvious. You
can drag the large slider in the middle for seeking. There are
two smaller sliders above that, the left one is for adjusting
the volume and the right one for adjusting the balance. Above
these, there are two horizontal text areas showing information
about the currently playing track, and input/output parameters
such as sample rate, mono/stereo, bitrate, output driver
(e.g. OSS, ALSA, JACK) etc. The first trick to learn is that
these lines are horizontally draggable with the mouse if the
text does not fit in the available visible space. However,
they don't scroll automatically, and for a very good reason.</p>

<p>In the upper left corner, you find one bigger and two
smaller displays that show track times: elapsed time,
remaining time and total track time. The big display also
shows the current volume and balance setting when
appropriate. By clicking in these displays, you can rearrange
the displays as you want them. The following figure shows how
the displays switch their contents after clicking into them
with the left (L) or right (R) mouse button.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="timer.png" alt="time displays reacting to mouse clicks" /></p>

<p>In the bottom right corner there are additional
buttons. The buttons with the letters display or hide
additional windows of the program:</p>

<table rules="all" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td>FX</td>
<td>Ladspa Patch Builder</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MS</td>
<td>Music Store</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PL</td>
<td>Playlist</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Note that depending on the skin, these buttons may come
with images instead of the letters above. However, their
functionality does not change.</p>

<p>The remaining three buttons are to select the playback
mode. When none of these buttons is depressed, playback goes
the normal way. The buttons are mutually exclusive, and select
track repeat, list repeat or shuffle mode. I'm sure you can
figure out which is which. If you select track repeat, a loop
bar appears above the seek bar, with two markers. The markers
can be dragged to select the looping range. When they are at
the left and right end positions, the whole song is repeated.
The looping range can also be selected using keyboard
shortcuts. When track repeat is enabled and the current song
is playing (or paused), `&lt;' will set the start of the
looping range to the current playing position; `&gt;' does
the same for the end of the looping range.</p>

<p>Volume and balance slider tricks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shift + any mouse button sets the volume and balance
sliders back to 0 dB and Center position, respectively. This
combination also works for the loop bar, in which case the
looping range is set to the whole song.</li>

<li>Clicking and holding the right mouse button on these
sliders shows their position in the big time display without
altering the value.</li>
</ul>

<p>An additional thing to know about the volume control is
that it ranges up to +6 dB. This means you can send a bigger
signal to the audio device than in the original file. With 0
dB corresponding to 100% signal level, +6 dB is almost exactly
200% signal level (and 4 times signal power as well). This
means you can overdrive your output device, and since clipping
will occur at 100% anyway, it will cause nasty digital
distortion much worse than simple analog overdrive. If you
have a track with a reasonably low level, you can go above 0
dB with the volume control. But today most CDs are mastered to
keep the average volume level very close to the 0 dB (or 100%)
top, and so they will likely distort with as little as +1 dB
additional gain. The moral is: if you want it loud, turn up
your external amp. You can also consider using RVA if the
volume level of your tracks tends to vary in a wide range
&ndash; see <a href="aqualung-doc-part_5_3.html#id477">this section</a> for
details.</p>

<p>On a related note, another thing to watch out for is LADSPA
plugins (in case you use them). It is very common that the
signal level leaving a plugin is greater than the signal level
the plugin gets on its input. So it is best to leave a few dB
of headroom if you do that. A very typical case is boosting
some frequency bands a few dB with an EQ plugin. You should
decrease the overall volume level with as much dB as the
largest boost (or even more), or you are risking that the
signal will get chopped causing bad distortion. Alternatively,
apply <a class="external" href="http://tap-plugins.sourceforge.net/ladspa/limiter.html">this
limiter plugin</a> as the last one in the processing chain,
but only if you know what you are doing.</p>

<p>Right-clicking almost anywhere in the window will bring up
a menu that allows access to the <span class="gui">Settings</span> dialog,
the <span class="gui">Skin Chooser</span>, the <span class="gui">JACK Port Setup</span>
dialog (present only when running the program with JACK
output), and the <span class="gui">About</span> box. The latter may be
useful to see which features have been compiled into the
program. (If you haven't read the <a class="external" href="http://aqualung.jeremyevans.net/compiling/">page about
compiling</a> yet: the configuration of the program can be
adapted so as not to require certain libraries when compiling,
and not provide certain features accordingly.)</p>
