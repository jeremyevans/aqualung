The Aqualung documentation is maintained in XML conforming to a custom
DTD created exclusively for this program. Other formats like HTML and
PDF and manual page are generated by applying XSL Stylesheets.

The latest version of the User's Manual is available for downloading
or reading at the project homepage:

http://aqualung.factorial.hu/docs.html

The full documentation can be generated by running `make aqualung-doc'.
The required tools are xsltproc (for all formats) and a decent LaTeX
distribution such as tetex of texlive (only for PDF).

The manual page is always accessible locally by typing `man aqualung'.
