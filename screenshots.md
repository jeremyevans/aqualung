Starting with version 2.0 of Aqualung (released in February 2025) the
program depends on the Gtk3 toolkit and uses CSS for (minimal) theming
of its interface. The previously existing skin support was removed,
and a single switch (the "Dark theme" checkbox on the General tab of
the Settings dialog) allows the user to request a dark appearance.
This new, basic look is demonstrated below; click on the pictures to
view them in full size.

## Legacy skins

The below screenshots were made with earlier versions of Aqualung
(using the Gtk2 toolkit), and demonstrate the program's appearance
with some of the skins. These are retained here, as they serve as a
nice gallery of program features as well. Click on the pictures to
view them in full size.
