Manual editing</h2>

<p>The <span class="gui">File info</span> dialog (<a href="aqualung-doc-part_4_3.html#idp2579782656">accessible</a> from the
Music Store and the Playlist) acts as a graphical shell for
the metadata editing capabilities. Its usage is fairly
self-explanatory. For read-only tags, the dialog has no
editing controls, so the only available operation is viewing
the fields, copy-pasting them to another location, or (if the
dialog was opened from the Music Store) importing the field to
the Music Store database. Embedded images can also be saved to
file.</p>

<p>For writable files, the metadata is editable. Each metadata
tag present in the file will be displayed in a separate
notebook tab. On each tab the information present in a tag is
usually organized as a list of frames, displayed in a
`key:value' fashion. The values of each frame are
editable, mostly by means of a simple text entry, but in some
cases other widgets (such as a drop-down menu) may also be
present. The frame itself can be removed by clicking on the
frame's rightmost icon displaying a trash can. Some frames
cannot be removed, because their existence is mandated by the
corresponding metadata standard for the tag. In this case the
trash can is greyed out.</p>

<p>Adding new frames is possible via the drop-down box at the
bottom of the tab. This box contains all possible frames that
you can add to the present tag. Some frames can only occur
once in a tag; in this case after adding it once (or if a
frame of this type is already present in the tag) it is no
more present in the drop-down box.</p>

<p>Adding and removing whole tags is also supported. Just
press the trash can icon at the bottom right corner of the
tab, and the whole tag will be removed. Adding a new tag is
possible via the drop-down box at the bottom of the
window. This box contains all possible tags you can add to
this file. This depends on the audio file format and what tags
are already present in the file (naturally, only one instance
of a particular tag may exist in a file).</p>
