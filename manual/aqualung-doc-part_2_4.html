Playing and ripping an Audio CD</h2>

<p>You can play CDs with Aqualung easily. Just put the CD in
one of your CD drives, and if everything goes well, Aqualung
will detect it, do a CDDB lookup to retrieve artist, record
and track info (CD-Text is also used if the CD has it), and
make it available to you through the special Music Store node
called `CD Audio'.</p>

<p>You don't have to be happy with what you have so far. The
Music Store paradigm is fairly addictive, as it's much easier
to drop something into the Playlist from the Music Store than
physically placing a CD in the drive. So as you keep expanding
your CD collection, you will probably want to have those
records in one of your music stores, too. In this case all you
have to do is choose <span class="gui">Rip CD...</span> from the disc's
popup menu, and supply some information. We won't go into
details here (please refer to <a href="aqualung-doc-part_4_3.html#idp2579785472">this
section</a> in case the interface is not obvious). However,
it is worth stating that you should have a separate directory
for the files of each record. Ripping multiple CDs into the
same directory won't work.</p>
