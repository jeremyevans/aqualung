Aqualung is officially released only as a source code tarball
archive. Download [release tarball
1.0](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/aqualung/aqualung-1.0.tar.gz)

The program is included in most major Linux distributions.

Post-1.0 development happens in git, hosted on GitHub:
[jeremyevans/aqualung](https://github.com/jeremyevans/aqualung)

To clone the source repository, type:  
`$ git clone git://github.com/jeremyevans/aqualung.git`

Remember to run `sh autogen.sh` in the root directory of the cloned
repository before running `./configure`. If you have the necessary
auto* packages installed, this is the only additional step needed
compared to compiling an official tarball release.
