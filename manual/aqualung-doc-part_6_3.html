<h3 id="idp978720384">6.3.1. Configuration</h3>

<p>Configuring metdata-related behavior can be done in
<span class="gui">Settings / Metadata</span>. The file metadata will
always be used if available when adding external files
(i.e. not from the Music Store) to Playlist. If no metadata
is found, the filename will be used as a title string. In
such cases the <span class="gui">Adding files to Playlist</span> option
controls whether to use the basename only instead of the
full pathname. You can utilize filename extension removal
and substitution of underscores to space as well.</p>

<p>It is possible to select which ReplayGain tag should be
used in case ReplayGain information is found in a file. This
should be set according to your preference for Album-based
or Track-based volume averaging. If the requested field is
not found, the other one is checked and if that exists, it
is used instead.</p>

<p>For the metadata editor (<span class="gui">File info</span> dialog) you
can choose whether you want to set the contents of newly
added frames on the basis of another existing tag's
equivalent frame. For example, if this option is enabled,
adding a `Title' frame to a newly added APE tag will
automatically fill it in, provided that there is e.g. an
ID3v2 tag in the same file that already has a `Title'
frame. If this option is unset, newly added fields will be
blank.</p>

<p>The last group of options controls the preferred set of
tags in MPEG audio files. Because these files can have
ID3v1, ID3v2 and APE tags in any combination, it is
essential to set this to match your policy regarding the
tagging of these files. These settings affect creating (via
CD ripping or file export) or batch tagging MPEG audio
files.</p>



<h3 id="idp3720097792">6.3.2. Precedence of metadata information</h3>

<p>Whenever there is a generic request for some information
concerning a file (e.g. `Who is the artist?') we do not
want to explicitly specify which metadata tag should be used
to retrieve the desired piece of data. As a consequence, all
tags present have to be checked. However, since not all tags
are equally capable of storing well-formed information
(think of ID3v1 limitations), there should be a preference
order in which the different tags are queried.</p>

<p>The preference order:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td>1.</td>
<td>MPEG StreamMeta</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2.</td>
<td>Generic StreamMeta</td>

<h3 id="idp670685952">6.3.3. ReplayGain and RVA</h3>

<p>Aqualung is a ReplayGain-aware music player. You have to
understand and use the <a href="aqualung-doc-part_5_3.html#idp3465702784">RVA system</a> in
order to make use of this. The RVA system relies on
pre-stored loudness measurements of files, which Aqualung
normally does by itself (by selecting the <span class="gui">Calculate
volume...</span> option from the popup menus). However, for
files already containing ReplayGain or RVA information, it
is possible to use that as the basis of volume
adjustment.</p>

<p>One way of doing this is importing the ReplayGain or RVA
frame to the Music Store as `manual RVA' (using the
<span class="gui">File info</span> dialog opened from the Music Store. In
this case the stored value is editable via the <span class="gui">Edit
track...</span> popup menu item, where you can also specify
such a value manually, if needed.</p>

<p>In case there is no `manual RVA' value stored for
the file, the RVA system will see if there is a previously
calculated loudness value stored for this track. If yes,
this will be the basis of a volume adjustment calculation,
which is controlled by <span class="gui">Settings / Playback RVA</span>
options. However, if the RVA system is enabled and neither
`manual RVA', nor loudness measurement is available,
Aqualung looks for ReplayGain or RVA information in the file
metadata. If such information is found, it is used in the
same way as `manual RVA', so the track's playback gain
will be adjusted by exactly the specified amount.</p>

<p>There is an important difference between `manual
RVA' data coming from a metadata tag or specified
directly by the user, and loudness values calculated by
Aqualung. The former is a volume adjustment in itself,
specifying the amount of cut or boost to apply when playing
the track. On the other hand, Aqualung's loudness levels
merely serve as an indicator of the track's loudness, and
are converted to actual volume adjustment values when adding
the track to the Playlist, via <a href="aqualung-doc-part_5_3.html#idp3465702784">Aqualung's
RVA algorithm</a>, which is a quite sophisticated tool
based on listening environments, also supporting
statistics-based handling of Album-based volume
averaging.</p>



<h3 id="idp2777869312">6.3.4. Metadata transfer when exporting</h3>

<p>When <a href="aqualung-doc-part_5_1.html#idp486846848">exporting files</a>,
Aqualung attempts to retain the metadata of the original
file as much as possible by transcoding metadata into the
tags supported by the output format. For each frame present
in the input metadata, it is determined whether it is
possible to add an equivalent frame to one of the tags
supported by the output format. If yes, the frame data is
converted and stored. Note that for each frame type
(e.g. `Title'), only one source tag is chosen to be
copied from even if it is present in more than one tag in
the input metadata. In this case the tag with the highest
<a href="aqualung-doc-part_6_3.html#idp3720097792">precedence</a> is used as
input. Of course, if more instances of the same frame are
present in the same tag (e.g. multiple APIC frames in an
ID3v2 tag), they are all transferred if the output metadata
format supports them.</p>

<p>This feature essentially means that files are transcoded
with intelligent metadata transfer. For example, exporting a
FLAC containing Ogg Vorbis comments and two FLAC picture
frames to MP3 will result in an MP3 with an ID3v2 having the
respective text frames, and two APIC frames for the
pictures.</p>

<p>When assembling the metadata written to the output file,
the information from the Music Store or Playlist (Title,
Artist, Album, Year, Track number) will be used in case the
source metadata does not contain the appropriate frames.</p>
